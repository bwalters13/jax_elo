* Make it easy to get the history of players. Maybe write another function
  called `calculate_ratings` or something like that which uses the old
  dictionary-based approach to store the history of ratings.
* Maybe not to this library, but _somewhere_, add functions related to betting.
* Also, it would be nice to be able to evaluate this model against others in a
  standardised way. I could incorporate it into my old `tpr` framework, or just
  have some standard functions to evaluate models...? Something to think about.
